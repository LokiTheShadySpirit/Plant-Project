## About The Project

This tool can be used to manage your households plants, by allowing you to join groups(households), where you can add and remove plants, and mark them as watered.

Here's why:

- I often find myself unsure about the condition of my plants because watering plants is rarely communicated well within my household.
- A central reference point for our plants makes it easy to inform others about what plants need water and when.
- Being able to set a timer for watering plants ensures that plants get the perfect amount of water they need.

### Built With
